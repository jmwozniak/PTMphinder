Title: An R package for PTM localization and motif extraction from proteomic datasets
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Jacob M. Wozniak
Maintainer: Jacob M. Wozniak <jakewozniak@gmail.com>
Description: The R package, PTMphinder, was designed to facilitate the in-depth analysis of proteomic data by researchers, even those with little programming background. The package contains three functions: parseDB, phindPTMs and extractBackground. Together, these functions allow users to reformat “.fasta” databases for easier analysis, localize the PTMs within full proteins, extract motifs surrounding identified PTMs and create proteome-specific motif backgrounds for statistical purposes.
